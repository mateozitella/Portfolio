                <p class="paragraph">I made this portfolio to give potential employers an opportunity to learn more about me and showcase some projects that I’ve worked on. </p>

                <p class="heading">Process</p>
                <p class="paragraph">I originally intended to use libraries like React JS or a framework like Tailwind CSS, but I eventually settled for basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript because I didn’t think there were going to be a lot of reusable components. I had some trouble with the home page because I didn’t understand CSS well enough, but after looking into flexbox and CSS cheat sheets, it was pretty easy to design the rest of the website. I chose to host the website on github because it was free, easy, and taught me a little bit about how github works. </p>

                <p class="heading">Results & Possible Improvements</p>
                <p class="paragraph">The web page looks good at the intended aspect ratio and 100% zoom, but breaks down at different aspect ratios and zooms. I could improve this in the future by adding some conditional code to handle different zooms or aspect ratios in Javascript, or making the design more vertical to accommodate mobile views. I intend to continue updating this page with future projects I work on.

I also physically weighed everything on a scale or found the theoretical weight shown on the 3D printer slicer software to make sure I satisfied the weight requirement. </p>

I 3D printed everything out of super PLA plus and put heat-set inserts on the top plate and frame. Additionally, I 3D printed a spacer for where the weapon motor mounts and a spacer for the bearing so that the weapon would fit better in the design. I had to make a couple 3D printed prototypes to make sure the design fit together properly.  </p>

                <p class="paragraph">The robot passed the test to qualify for the competition, which involved testing the drive, weapon, and weapon lock. When the robot actually competed, it had an issue where the weapon would slow down every time it drove. This might’ve happened because the battery wasn’t charged enough, or because something was wrong with my weapon motor, which I noticed was abnormally hot to the touch after competing. For next time, I want to place the drive motors closer to the center of mass of the robot to improve it's drive functionality.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">After doing research on causes of injury amongst elderly people, my forge team and I found that most injuries are caused while navigating stairs. Traditional canes do little to help since using them to navigate stairs can be awkward and difficult for elderly people. To try to prevent injuries, we designed Smart Step, a cane with a height changing mechanism. I was tasked with designing the body section of the tube, which involved a height changing mechanism. </p>

                <p class="heading">Design & Planning</p>
                <p class="paragraph">The design involves a telescopic actuator mechanism, with an aluminum threaded rod in the middle that is connected to a motor at the top, allowing it to rotate. The lower body tube is constrained to translational motion by a glider that runs along a thin aluminum rod acting as a track. A 3D printed piece on the bottom of the upper body tube holds the thin aluminum rod, and  4 3D printed parts hold 2 threaded nuts in place on the lower body tube, allowing the nuts to interface with the threaded aluminum rod. </p>

For the inner body tube, I used a drill press with a smaller and larger tool to make the screws flush with the exterior of the tube. I also designed a piece to hold the motor down so that it wouldn’t get pushed out of place when force was applied. </p>

                <p class="paragraph">It took about 9 seconds for the cane to fully extend from a contracted position, which is too slow for elderly people to use. To cut costs, we used a motor that we found in a scrap motor bucket at a makerspace. If I were doing the project again, I would put more thought into selecting a motor based on torque and speed requirements. Additionally, getting an aluminum rod with a larger pitch could also help increase speed (while also increasing the required torque).</p>

                <p class="paragraph">I originally made a design where the laser hits the sample from the front and exits to a side plane, but when the professor updated me on the design he said it needed to emit the laser out of the top plane because of the experiment conditions. The K-shaped holder was the first prototype and the circular one is the final project. For the final project, an adapter connects the holder to the experiment setup, and a small screw holding the actual material mount in place. Both designs have magnets on either side of the sample.</p>
